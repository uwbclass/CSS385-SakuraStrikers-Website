### Team JOGM's Reflection {#team-reflection}
Overall it was a great experience. We believe everyone did their best given the diversity of the group. Everyone contributed something different to make a whole functioning game. If we were given two more weeks, we would focus our time on debugging the fighting mechanic and adding more depth to the character selection. There are certain conditions that break the fighting using stuns. Also, not utilizing a global manager early on made developing the character selection difficult.
